# Tic-Tac-Toe
A fun game for two players. The player who succeeds in placing three of their tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Technologies Used
This project was written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Adobe Animate CC was used to create the character animations which were employed as sprite animations controlled by CSS. Animate.css was also used to provide gameboard interactivity.

## Approach to Solving Problems
Finding the correct logic for the JS wasn't easy, however, in the end I put all winning combinations in an array and searched for a winning combo.

## Next Steps
- Add more animations:
  - Sad losing animation
  - Draw animations
  - Waiting animations (waving, looking at clock)
- Add customisation:
  - choose your character
  - choose your token
